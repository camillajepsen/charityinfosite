                <br><br>
                Giving is good for you, according to Deakin University. 
                <br><span class="quote">Research shows people who are keen to do good are more likely to rate themselves as happy. This is the power of generosity – it benefits giver and receiver.</span>
                <br><br>
                Consider this thought experiment; On your way to work, you pass a small pond where children sometimes play. It’s early and cool, so you’re surprised to see a toddler struggling in the water, unable to stay upright. No one else is around, and the child can barely keep her head above water. If you don’t step in, she will likely drown.
                <br><br>
                Rescuing her is easy, but your new shoes and suit will be ruined, and you’ll be late for work. What do you do?
                <br><br>
                Most people would say, "Of course, I would save the child". But in 2017, 5.4 million children under five died—most from preventable causes. A man in Ghana told a researcher:
                <br><br>
                <span class="quote">"A small boy died this morning from measles. He could have been treated, but his parents had no money, so he died—not from measles, but poverty."</span>
                <br><br>
                This happens every day. Some children starve. Others die from measles, malaria, or diarrhea—illnesses easily treated in developed countries. They lack safe water, sanitation, and medical care. Charities like Oxfam, the Against Malaria Foundation, and Evidence Action are fighting poverty, disease, and unsafe living conditions. With more funding, they could save even more lives.
                <br><br>
                The thought experiment above is from Peter Singer's book <i>The life you can save</i>. He argues that we have the ability to save lives with relatively small effort and we have a responsibility to do so. 
                Some people enjoy donating their money, other enjoy donating their time, skills or belongings. Finding an act of generosity that feels good for you is the most sustainable and beneficial way of contributing, which is why I have developed this site to help you navigate the world of charity.
